# Trees

#### 1) TreeHeight: You are given a description of a rooted tree. Your task is to compute and output its height. Recall that the height of a (rooted) tree is the maximum depth of a node, or the maximum distance fromleaf to the root. You are given an arbitrary tree, not necessarily a binary tree.a leaf to the root. You are given an arbitrary tree, not necessarily a binary tree.

#### 2) LevelOrderRecursion: Complete the function to print spiral order traversal of a tree.

#### 3) LevelOrderZigZagO(1): Complete the function to print spiral order traversal of a tree.O(1).

#### 4) mirrorRecursive: Given a Binary Tree, convert it into its mirror.

#### 5) mirrorIterative: Given a binary Tree, convert it into its mirror.

#### 6) NoSibling: Given a Binary Tree of size N, such that all nodes have distinct values, print all the nodes which don't have a sibling node in sorted order. If all nodes have a sibling node then print -1 .

#### 7) SumTree: Write a function that returns true if the given Binary Tree of size N is SumTree else return false. A SumTree is a Binary Tree in which value of each node x is equal to sum of nodes present in its left subtree and right subtree . An empty tree is SumTree and sum of an empty tree can be considered as 0. A leaf node is also considered as SumTree.

#### 8) haspathSum: Given a Binary Tree and a sum s, your task is to check whether there is a root to leaf path in that tree with the following sum . You are required to complete the function hasPathSum. You should not read any input from stdin/console. There are multiple test cases. For each test case, this method will be called individually.

#### 9) treeFromPreorderInorder: Given 2 Arrays of Inorder and preorder traversal. Construct a tree and print the Postorder traversal.
