# Trees

#### 1) TreeHeight: You are given a description of a rooted tree. Your task is to compute and output its height. Recall that the height of a (rooted) tree is the maximum depth of a node, or the maximum distance fromleaf to the root. You are given an arbitrary tree, not necessarily a binary tree.a leaf to the root. You are given an arbitrary tree, not necessarily a binary tree.

#### 2) LevelOrderRecursion: Complete the function to print spiral order traversal of a tree.

#### 3) LevelOrderZigZagO(1): Complete the function to print spiral order traversal of a tree.O(1).

#### 4) mirrorRecursive: Given a Binary Tree, convert it into its mirror.

#### 5) mirrorIterative: Given a binary Tree, convert it into its mirror.

#### 6) NoSibling: Given a Binary Tree of size N, such that all nodes have distinct values, print all the nodes which don't have a sibling node in sorted order. If all nodes have a sibling node then print -1 .
